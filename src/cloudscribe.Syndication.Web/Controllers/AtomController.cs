// TODO: implement? having used my best google fu it seems best practice is to only provide one feed
// https://blog.superfeedr.com/feeds/rss/atom/best%20practice/feed-publishing-best-practices/
// rather than both an rss feed and an atom feed
// since the rss feed is working and is probably all I really need I'm leaving this
// unimplemented for now. if someone else wants to implement it and send a pull request
// that would be great
